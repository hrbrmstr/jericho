Description: Structured 'HTML' content can be useful when you need to parse data tables
    or other tagged data from within a document. However, it is also useful to obtain
    "just the text" from a document free from the walls of tags that surround it. Tools
    are provied that wrap methods in the 'Jericho HTML Parser' Java library by 
    Martin Jericho <http://jericho.htmlparser.net/docs/index.html>. Martin's library
    is used in many at-scale projects, icluding the 'The Internet Archive'.
